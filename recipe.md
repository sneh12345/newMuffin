And here's the recipe ðŸ¤«:

In a bowl, put the white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter. And whisk it all together until a paste has formed with no lumps.
Then, crack in the egg, pour in the vanilla, and then whisk until light ribbons fall of the whisk.
Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier cookies.
Put in the chocolate chunks, and then fold them evenly, then chill the dough for 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
Cool completely, and enjoy!
